## Application Overview
Postivism is a new take on Social Media where anyone can post whatever they want, completely anonymously. Personal attacks and censorship has become a major problem online. We wanted to give the people the chance to post what they have on their mind and ideas will be based on _merit_ rather than popularity. Users are able to create an account, post what is on their mind anonymously, and also see what others have said around the world.
